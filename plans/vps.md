# 💻 Virtual Servers

Virtual servers are a versatile solution suitable for a wide range of tasks where stability, flexibility, and full control are required.

VPS can handle both small projects and resource-intensive services that require more than your typical web hosting.

You get full access to the operating system, letting you configure the server exactly for your needs. With VPS, you can host VPN servers, websites and web applications, databases, Telegram bots, control panels, proxy services, monitoring systems, API services, and much more.

Our virtual servers are available in several European locations - Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands - allowing you to choose the optimal location for minimum latency and a stable connection with your audience.

The complete list of plans is available on [our website](https://senko.digital/virtual-servers).
