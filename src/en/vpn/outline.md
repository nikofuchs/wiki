# Outline VPN Installation Guide

<img src="/images/vpn/outline/outline-logo.png" style="display: flex !important; justify-content: center !important; height: 500px;"></img>

Outline is a modern, fast, and secure VPN solution developed by Jigsaw (a subsidiary of Google). It uses the Shadowsocks protocol and provides an easy-to-use management app for configuring your VPN server and clients. This guide will walk you through installing and configuring Outline on your server.

:::: tip
Our hosting clients have access to a fully automated Outline installation script during initial service ordering, or through scripts in the VM control panel. After the script finishes, you'll receive connection details for Outline Connect and management details for Outline Manager.
::::

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A server running a supported Linux distribution (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux/Rocky/Fedora)
- Root or sudo access to the server
- Basic knowledge of command line operations
- The server's public IP address
- A device to install the Outline Manager app (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

## Installation

### Automatic Installation for Hosting Clients

#### During Service Order

In the order menu, select "Outline" from the dropdown menu, complete the order and wait for service processing to finish.

Immediately after server activation, you will receive an email containing your Outline Manager URL and access credentials. You can use these to connect to your server through the Outline client, or manage your VPN server through the Outline Manager app.

#### Through the VM Panel

Go to the [VM control panel](https://vm.senko.digital), navigate to the management of the desired server, expand the "Menu" in the top right corner and select "Run script".

In the dialog, select the "Outline" option and enable "Send email associated with script".

After installation is complete, you will receive an email with your Outline Manager URL and access credentials. You can then use these to connect to your server through the Outline client, or manage your VPN server through the Outline Manager app.

### Manual Installation

The installation process varies depending on your Linux distribution. Make sure to use the correct commands for the installation process.

::: code-group

```bash [Ubuntu/Debian]
# Update package list
apt-get update -y

# Install required dependencies
apt-get install -y curl jq
```

```bash [RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux/Rocky/Fedora]
# Install EPEL repository (if not already installed)
yum install -y epel-release
# OR for newer systems:
dnf install -y epel-release

# Install required dependencies
yum install -y curl jq
# OR for newer systems:
dnf install -y curl jq
```

:::

#### Run the Official Outline Installer

The Outline project provides an official installation script that handles all the complex setup:

```bash
# Download and run the official Outline installer
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/master/src/server_manager/install_scripts/install_server.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Set up the Outline server with Shadowsocks
- Configure the management interface
- Generate server certificates
- Start all necessary services

## Installing the Outline Manager App

After installation, you'll need to install the Outline Manager app to configure your VPN server and create client access keys.

### Download the Outline Manager App

Download the Outline Manager app for your platform:

- **Windows**: [Download from official website](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-1)
- **macOS**: [Download from official website](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-1) or [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/outline-manager/id1356177745)
- **Linux**: [Download from official website](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-1)

### Finding Your Server Configuration

The installation script will output a JSON configuration containing your server details. Look for output similar to:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "https://your-server-ip:port/your-server-id",
  "certSha256": "your-certificate-hash"
}
```

Copy these details for later.

If you can't find the server configuration, you can check the installation logs:

```bash
# Check the installation log for the server configuration
cat /var/log/outline-install.log | grep -E "(apiUrl|certSha256)"
```

### Adding Your Server to Outline Manager

1. **Install and launch** the Outline Manager app
2. **Choose "Set up Outline anywhere"** in the provider selection

### Creating Access Keys

Access keys are what clients use to connect to your Outline server. Each key represents a unique connection.

#### Creating Your First Access Key

1. **Click "Add new key"** in the Outline Manager app
![Outline Manager - Add new key](/images/vpn/outline/add-new-key.png){data-zoomable}
2. **Choose a name** for the key (e.g., "My Phone", "Laptop")
3. **Set data limits** (optional)
4. **Click "Add"** to create the key

The system will immediately generate a unique access URL (starting with `ss://`) that clients will use to connect.

With Outline Manager you can:

- **Rename keys**
- **Monitor traffic usage** per key
- **Set or reset data limits**

To view/share a key, click the **Share** icon next to it, and the access key will be shown.

3. **Test internet connectivity** - Ensure you can browse the web normally
4. **Check connection stability** - Leave the connection active for a while to test stability

## Firewall Configuration

Outline uses Shadowsocks protocol and typically runs on a custom port. Make sure your firewall allows the necessary traffic:

### For UFW (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
# Allow the Outline port (check the actual port in your manager URL)
ufw allow 443/tcp
ufw allow 80/tcp

# If using a custom port, replace 443 with your actual port
ufw allow CUSTOM/tcp
```

### For firewalld (RHEL/CentOS):

```bash
# Allow the Outline port
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload

# If using a custom port, replace 443 with your actual port
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=CUSTOM/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Managing Users and Access

### Adding Multiple Users

1. **Create additional access keys** in the Outline Manager app
