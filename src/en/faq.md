# 🤔 Frequently asked questions

## 🌐 Where are your servers located?

Our servers are provided in two main locations: **Germany**, **Frankfurt-am-Main**, **Finland**, **Helsinki** and **the Netherlands**, **Amsterdam**.

## 🏢 Which data centers do you use for your servers? Are they reliable?

For our German location, we utilize Firstcolo's data center facilities in Frankfurt-am-Main. Firstcolo is known for their powerful infrastructure and excellent connectivity within Central and Western Europe.

For our Finnish location, while the servers are physically hosted in Hetzner's Helsinki facility, virtual servers are not directly exposed through Hetzner's network. Instead, we use a different upstream provider to ensure optimal performance and reliability for our customers.

For our Dutch location, we utilize Equinix's data center facilities in Amsterdam and Zwolle.

## 🛡️ Do you offer any DDoS protection?

In Germany, we provide basic Layer 3 and Layer 4 DDoS protection for all services. We are actively working on expanding our protection capabilities to include Layer 7 protection in the near future.

In Finland and the Netherlands, DDoS protection is currently unavailable for all of our plans.

## 💵 What payment methods are available?

We support more than 20 different payment methods, including debit and credit cards, such as **Visa**, **MasterCard**, and **American Express**, as well as electronic payment networks like **PayPal** and **Alipay**.

We also accept over 80 cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins and on-chain coins like **USDT**, **TON**, **Bitcoin**, **Litecoin**, **Monero**, and many others.

## 🕒 How long does server setup take?

Virtual servers are set up automatically within 120 seconds after payment. In rare cases, e.g. if you have selected Windows as your OS, server installation may take up to 10 minutes, or when a plan is in very high demand, the setup process may take up to 24 hours.

Dedicated servers require manual configuration and may take up to five business days to be activated. We always do our best to activate these as quickly as possible; however, hardware shortages or supplier delays may occasionally delay the process.

Game hosting servers typically take approximately 24 hours to process after payment.

## 🛒 How do I order a VPS server?

Detailed instructions for ordering a VPS server are [available in this article](/personal-area/vps-order).

## 💻 How do I access the game panel?

The game panel is available at [panel.senko.digital](https://panel.senko.digital).

Login requires:
- The email address used for your personal account registration
- Your game panel password (either set during initial server order or your existing game panel password)

## 📊 Can I change my plan after purchase?

Yes, you can always upgrade your server plan to a more powerful one within the same line of plans. Plan changes are applied within a couple of minutes and do not require server reinstallation.

## ❓ How long will my data be stored if my service gets suspended?

If your service is suspended (for example, due to non-payment), your data will be stored for up to 3 days. After this period, the server and all associated data will be automatically deleted from our systems.
